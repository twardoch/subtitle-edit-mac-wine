2. Ctrl+click `install-mac.command` and choose _Open_. If asked for confirmation, choose _Open_.
3. When asked, go to the [Subtitle Edit releases page](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit/releases)
4. In the _Latest releases_ section, right click the ZIP for the Portable version, for example [`SE360.zip`](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit/releases/download/3.6.0/SE360.zip) and copy the link

## Running GUI app

Open Terminal.app and type:

## Using in command-line

Open Terminal.app and type:

### Example

Convert all .srt subtitles in INFOLDER into .srt in the OUTFOLDER and perform some fixes (replace the `.` in `INFOLDER=` and `OUTFOLDER=` with actual folder paths).

```
INFOLDER=. && OUTFOLDER=. && mkdir -p "$OUTFOLDER" && subtitleeditw /convert '*.srt' subrip /inputfolder:"$INFOLDER" /outputfolder:"$OUTFOLDER" /overwrite /FixCommonErrors /MergeSameTimeCodes /MergeSameTexts /MergeShortLines /RedoCasing;
